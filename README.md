Website to facilitate communication between tutors and students depending on their classes.

Updated May/June 2019 to be more object-oriented as opposed to running procedural code.

* Search functionality for both subjects and staff.
* Admin user can access a portal that allows them to create new users, subjects, search all available users, edit any user or subject and enroll students and tutors in subjects.
* Each user has a profile page that the user (or admin) can edit including updating password and adding a profile image (provided user is not a student).
